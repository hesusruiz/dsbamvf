    'Resolve the DID of Packet Delivery
    customerSIOP -> DIDR ++: Resolve DID of\nPacket Delivery in\n**Trusted Participant List**
    note right DIDR
        This is a Universal Resolver server, that receives a DID and resolves it to a DID Document.
        The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owning the DID,
        containing:
        - The Public Key of the entity used to verify its digital signature
        - Status of the entity in the Trusted Participant List

        The DID Document is extensible, and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case.
        The Universal Resolver server has to be operated by a trusted entity for the customer and for minimizing the
        required trust in the ecosystem there may be as many nodes as needed operated by different entities.
        At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the wallet of the user.
        FIWARE uses a Universal Resolver accessing a blockchain network where the Trusted Lists are managed, but Trusted Lists
        can be implemented with any technology suitable for the ecosysmen.
    end note

    'Verify the Authentication Request using the DID Document
    customerSIOP -> customerSIOP: Verify Authentication Request
    note right customerSIOP
        The wallet checks:
        - the digital signature of the Authentication Request
        - that the DID inside the request matches the DID inside the DID Document from Universal Resolver
        - any additional info inside the request against the DID Document, as required by the use case

        Now the wallet knows that Packet Delivery Co is a
        trusted participant entity and that it signed the request and the request has not been modified
        since it was signed.

        This can be a Universal Resolver operated by Packet Delivery Co or by any entity trusted by it.
        For maximum level of trust, the node is operated by Packet Delivery.
        The Verifiable Credential received from the user was signed by Happy Pets and
        includes the DID of Happy Pets.
        Packet Delivery retrieves the DID Document for that DID to check that it is a trusted participant entity.
        In addition it checks the digital signature using the Public Key inside the DID Document.

    note over packetDeliverySIOP
        The VC issued by Happy Pets to the customer includes the Public Key associated to the customer
        and that was used to sign the Authentication Response.
        The Public Key of the customer was verified when the customer was onboarded by Happy Pets.
        For maximum privacy, SIOP (customer) can have a different key for each company where she is a customer.
        In each onboarding process the SIOP can generate a different key pair (pairwise DIDs).

    note over packetDeliverySIOP
        The RP component of Packet Delivery notifies the Portal to refresh the login page so
        it can present the services to the customer.
        The notification includes the following:
        - the <state> nonce that was generated by the portal when it generated the QR code. The
        portal uses the <state> nonce to know what login session is notified.
        - The <Access Token> generated before

        The notification URL is configured in the RP component

note over packetDeliverySIOP
   The authentication process has been finished and we still have to perform authorisation.
   At this point, Packet Delivery knows:
      1. That Happy Pets is a trusted participant entity
      2. That happy Pets says that the user is a customer
      3. The category of customer (Normal/Gold)
      4. Any user info encoded into the VC, like customer id

   However, Packet Delivery still does not know Happy Pets can issue credentials
   of type Gold (and also Normal). We will check this when the customer chooses a specific
   service, which could be avaliable to all customers (Normal) or only Gold customers
